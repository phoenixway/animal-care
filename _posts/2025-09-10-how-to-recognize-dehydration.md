## Why Dehydration is a Serious Threat

Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid than it takes in. For animals, especially strays or those who are unwell, it can quickly become a life-threatening condition. Water is essential for every bodily function, from circulation to digestion. Understanding the signs of dehydration is a critical skill for any volunteer or pet owner.

This guide will help you identify the key symptoms and know what immediate steps to take.

### Key Signs of Dehydration

You don't need special equipment to check for dehydration. Here are a few simple tests you can perform.

#### 1. The Skin Turgor (Elasticity) Test
This is the most common method.
* Gently grasp the skin on the back of the animal's neck or between the shoulder blades.
* Lift it up, and then release it.
* In a well-hydrated animal, the skin will snap back into place almost immediately.
* If the skin returns slowly, or stays in a "tent," the animal is likely dehydrated.

#### 2. Check the Gums
* Gently lift the animal's lip to look at their gums.
* The gums should be moist and slick. If they are dry, sticky, or tacky to the touch, it's a clear sign of dehydration.
* Also, check the capillary refill time. Gently press a finger against the gums until they turn white, then release. The color should return to pink in less than 2 seconds. A slower return indicates poor circulation, often related to dehydration.

#### 3. Sunken Eyes (Запалі очі)
A dehydrated animal's eyes may appear sunken into their sockets and look dull.

#### 4. Lethargy and Weakness
The animal may be unusually tired, weak, or unresponsive. They might be unwilling to stand or move.

### What to Do Immediately

If you suspect mild dehydration:
1.  **Provide fresh, clean water.** Make sure it's easily accessible.
2.  **Offer wet food.** If the animal is unwilling to drink, the high moisture content in wet food can help rehydrate them.
3.  **Consider an electrolyte solution.** You can purchase unflavored pediatric electrolyte solutions (like Pedialyte) from a pharmacy. Offer a small amount in a separate bowl. **Never force an animal to drink.**

### **When to See a Veterinarian Immediately**

The steps above are first aid, not a cure. Dehydration is often a symptom of a more serious underlying issue (like kidney disease, heatstroke, or infection).

**Seek immediate professional veterinary help if:**
* The animal is extremely lethargic or won't stand.
* The skin "tent" stays up for several seconds.
* The animal is vomiting or has diarrhea, as this will worsen fluid loss.
* The animal refuses to eat or drink anything.
